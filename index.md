### **Introduction**

Design and implementation of software to monitor the level of the content of 7 silos in an industrial plant in North Dakota.

The silos are grouped in 2 blocks (one contains 3 and the other 4 silos) in two areas located 150 meters from each others.

Each silo has 8 sensors to monitor the content level and a temperature and humidity sensor outside to monitor the outside environment.

All the sensors are connected to a PLC that compute and elaborate all the data.

A local server taks all the necessary data from the PLC and send them to a server in the cloud where they are displayed in real time.

## Initial brainstorming
In our initial brainstorming, we gathered as much information as possible about the client situation and we wrote a [quote](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFkHjfYeW-Sfa_ytyjblEQrI2LBM1ptnCbwFwMFPR2o/edit?usp=sharing) and a detailed overview and description of the project that can be found on [Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fkmiSBm4CSdgFqRkSN6lpyPtMEcRqfq6pHE84sshr5w/edit?usp=sharing)

During this phase we created some diagram to better understand the project that can be found below.

## Project Plannning
After the initial draft we focused on planning the whole project and more specifically we broke down the project into small tasks creating a Work Breakdown Structure specifying if a task will depend on another task.
