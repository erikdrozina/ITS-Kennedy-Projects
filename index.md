## Introduction
Design and implementation of software to monitor the level of the content of 7 silos in an industrial plant in North Dakota.
The silos are grouped in 2 blocks (one contains 3 and the other 4 silos) in two areas located 150 meters from each others.
Each silo has 8 sensors to monitor the content level and a temperature and humidity sensor outside to monitor the outside environment.
All the sensors are connected to a PLC that compute and elaborate all the data.
A local server taks all the necessary data from the PLC and send them to a server in the cloud where they are displayed in real time.
